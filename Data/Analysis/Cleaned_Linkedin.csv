Growing up, life was fairly simple, I studied during the day and rode my bike in the evening. Growing up I have always loved math and computers and following the signs and the yellow brick road led me to become a data scientist today.To put it simply, what I do is help the business teams tackle their issues by using data-driven methods. Oftentimes, business issues can be solved through building a simple machine learning model. Only when the problem is harder to be solved then we bring it the big gun of deep learning models. Because as Occam's Razor theory put it best, the simplest way is often the best way.I love being a data scientist and as I happen to be easily bored, this work presents a different problem to be solved on every project and as such I always learn and experience something new.  A few notable projects that I have created are:- Parent status prediction (Predicting whether a user is a parent or not)- Browsing time prediction (Predicting the time of the day user are most active)- Revamped the core ranking algorithm used by TokopediaIf you're a student and an aspiring data scientist don't be afraid to connect and hit me up to discuss anything.
